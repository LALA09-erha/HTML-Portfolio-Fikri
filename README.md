- **index.html**: The main structure of the web portfolio, featuring semantic HTML elements such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<aside>`. The header contains a navigation menu, the main section includes articles about personal information, skills, projects, and testimonials, while the aside features a profile picture and additional personal details.

- **css/styles.css**: Contains styles for the web portfolio. Implements a responsive layout using flexbox, applies a color scheme of yellow and Prussian blue, and ensures proper padding and margin for all elements. Media queries are included to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.

- **js/script.js**: Contains JavaScript code for DOM manipulation. Includes functionality for a sticky navbar that remains visible on scroll and transforms into a breadcrumb-style navigation on smaller devices. It may also include logic for dropdowns or sliders to enhance user interaction.
